ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Omar Khalili, a 20-year-old AI student in my 3rd year at An-Najah University. Iâ€™ve been programming for the past two years, and in that short time, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for building efficient, user-friendly software. I'm looking to grow both personally and professionally as I transition into a career in software engineering.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m skilled in:

Web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express
Backend: MongoDB, Oracle, Firebase, AWS Deployment
Programming: Python, C++, C
Problem-solving, team leadership, and project management
ðŸš€ Key projects:

Scriptoria: A collaborative platform for writing and reading stories, comics, and manga.
YUM-TA-DUM: A recipe management system optimized for performance and data integrity.
Random Variable: A Python app with a GUI for calculating random variables, useful for students and educators in statistics.
